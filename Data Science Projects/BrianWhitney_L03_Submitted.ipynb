    "In this assignment we want to get comfortable with loading and manipulating data in Python. While future assignments will focus more using structured data which we can load into a `DataFrame` using `pandas`, this assignment is focused on semi-structured data and how we can \"flatten\" it and then load it into other formats. The objective is to see how data flows in Python from one object to another and what advantages and disadvantages each offers.\n",
